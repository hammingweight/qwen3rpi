What was St Petersburg in Russia called before 1990?

The user might be looking for a specific name that refers to the city. I should check if there's any known alternative name. I vaguely recall that it used to be called KÃ¶nigsberg before 1800. Wait, but how did that come about? Maybe in  
the time of Tsar Peter the Great. 

Also, considering the user's query is about Russia, I need to confirm if there's a commonly accepted alternative name. I think the official name is St. Petersburg. But maybe some sources use different terms. Let me think about the       
timeline. After 1800, during the Russian Empire, it was called St. Petersburg. Before that, in the 18th century, when Russia was expanding, maybe called something else. 

I should verify if there's another name. Oh right, the city was called "Kremlin," a term from the Russian word for the city. But that might be from the 19th century. So, the answer might be 

Before 1990, St. Petersburg was known as Leningrad . This name was adopted in 1924, shortly after the death of Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution. Prior to that, the city had been renamed Petrograd in 1914 (during World War I, to remove the German-sounding "Petersburg") and retained that name until 1924.

The original name, St. Petersburg , was restored in 1991 following a public referendum after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Thus, during the Soviet period up until 1990, the city was officially called Leningrad .
